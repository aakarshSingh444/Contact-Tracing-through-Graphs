# Contact-Tracing-through-Graphs
Java based back-end system to trace the cause of disease outbreaks as they occur within a community, by modelling the community and the contacts each member has. 

This project contains the implementation of the graph structures, classes, methods, and attributes. It also employs the use of breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms. Extensive unit testing has been carried out.
